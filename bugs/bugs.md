add a "open viewer" option to the systray menu which opens https://1lap.github.io/viewer/



opening settings and then opening "check for updates" creates windows that can't be dismissed? even opening settings twice appears to lock windows up?



need branding, the app icon and the systray icon are a bit boring.


using the rest-api causes the game to stutter, so we should not hit the rest-api unless 100% required, cache the track map on session start instead of fetching it each lap.
